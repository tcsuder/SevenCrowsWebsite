# Seven Crows Business Website

#### This site serves multiple purposes. It represents in many ways the culmination of my self study before attending Epicodus. My use of css selectors, properties and values, and html elements is a result of pragmatic web searches. I feel very accomplished to have a site in production, and I'm glad to have been given the opportunity to make it for someone who's just getting their business of the ground. If I have time intend to refactor now that I could probably achieve the same styling and jquery transitions without the boostrap theme. For now, Kerry's happy, I'm happy, and I have bigger fish to fry!
